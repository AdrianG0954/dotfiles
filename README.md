# Dotfiles

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure to install all packages specified in the `Brewfile`. Once thatâ€™s done, you can proceed with setting up the dotfiles.

## Linking
I use **GNU Stow** to manage symbolic links. For more information, visit the [GNU Stow website](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

After linking your dotfiles with Stow, you should see the changes take effect immediately.
